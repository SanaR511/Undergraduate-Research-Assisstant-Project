# Undergraduate-Research-Assisstant-Project
In this research project, I examined different Task Scheduling Algorihtms used in cloud computing to create new algorithms that produce different results and interpetrations that may improve the cloud computing process. The main algorithms I focused on were the Sufferage, Max-min, and Min-min algorithms and modified the Sufferage and Max-min algorithms.
# Research Paper
The document titled TaskSchedulingAlgorithms-SanaRashid is the research paper accociated with this project.
The paper goes into detail of what each algorithm does and related works I used that assissted me with this project
